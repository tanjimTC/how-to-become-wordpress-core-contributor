## **How to Become a WordPress Core Contributor: A Step-by-Step Guide**


If you're passionate about WordPress and want to give back to the community, becoming a WordPress Core Contributor is one of the most rewarding ways to do so. Not only will you be contributing to a platform that powers over 40% of the web, but you'll also gain invaluable experience, improve your coding skills, and connect with a global community of developers. As someone who has contributed to WordPress Core, I can tell you firsthand that it’s a fulfilling journey. Here’s how you can get started.

## **Why Contribute to WordPress Core?**
Before diving into the technical details, let’s talk about why you should contribute to WordPress Core.

**Impact**: WordPress powers over 1.3 billion websites. Your contributions will directly impact millions of users worldwide.

**Skill Development**: You’ll work with some of the best developers in the world, learn best practices, and improve your coding skills.

**Community**: You’ll become part of a global community of developers, designers, and contributors who are passionate about open-source software.

**Recognition**: Your contributions will be recognized, and you’ll gain credibility in the WordPress ecosystem.

As [Jean-Baptiste Audras pointed out in his 2022 article](https://jeanbaptisteaudras.com/en/2022/05/wp-6-0-arturo-contribution-stats/), WordPress Core contributions are growing, and the community is more welcoming than ever. Now is the perfect time to get involved.

## **Setting Up Your Environment**
To start contributing to WordPress Core, you’ll need to set up a local development environment. Here’s what you’ll need:

**Requirements**:

- PHP: WordPress is built on PHP, so you’ll need a working PHP environment.
- MySQL: WordPress uses MySQL for its database.
- Docker: Docker simplifies the setup process by containerizing the environment. [Install Docker](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/setup/install/mac-install/).
- Node.js: Some parts of WordPress Core use Node.js for building assets. Install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/).

**Step 1: Fork and Clone WordPress Core**

1. Fork the WordPress Core repository on GitHub: [WordPress/wordpress-develop](https://github.com/WordPress/wordpress-develop).
2. Clone your forked repository locally:
 `git clone https://github.com/your-username/wordpress-develop.git`

**Step 2: Install Dependencies**

1. Navigate to the cloned repository:
 `cd wordpress-develop`
 
2. Install Node dependencies:
 `npm install`

3. Install PHP dependencies:
 `composer install`

**Step 3: Build and Start the Environment**
1. Build the source files:
`npm run build:dev`

2. Start the Docker container:
`npm run env:start`

3. Install WordPress:
`npm run env:install`

By default, you can access your local WordPress site at http://localhost:8889 with the following credentials:

- Username: admin
- Password: password

## **Common Setup Issues and Solutions**

**1. Dependency Version Mismatch**
If you encounter issues during npm install, it’s likely due to a dependency version mismatch. Make sure you’re using the correct versions of Node.js and PHP as specified in the .nvmrc and composer.json files.

**2. Docker Platform Mismatch**
If you’re using an M1 MacBook, you might face platform mismatch issues. To resolve this, add the following line to your docker-compose.yml file:

`platform: linux/x86_64`

**3. Docker Issues**
If Docker continues to give you trouble, consider using OrbStack as a replacement for Docker Desktop. It’s faster and more reliable, especially for M1 Mac users.

Understanding the Codebase
Before you start contributing, it’s essential to understand the WordPress Core codebase. Here are some key files and their roles:

- package.json: Manages Node.js dependencies and scripts.
- composer.json: Manages PHP dependencies.
- .nvmrc: Specifies the Node.js version.
- .npmrc: Configures npm behavior.
- docker-compose.yml: Defines the Docker environment.
- Gruntfile.js: A task runner for JavaScript.
- webpack.config.js: Bundles JavaScript and CSS files.
- .editorconfig: Ensures consistent coding styles across editors.

**Start Contributing**

1. Join the WordPress Community
Slack: Join the [WordPress Slack](https://make.wordpress.org/chat/) to connect with other contributors. Once you’re logged in, you can join channels like #core, #good-first-bugs and #polyglots.

Trac: WordPress uses Trac for issue tracking. Visit [core.trac.wordpress.org](https://core.trac.wordpress.org/) to find open tickets.

2. Find a Good First Bug
Start with a “good first bug” to get familiar with the contribution process. You can find these tickets here: [Good First Bugs](https://core.trac.wordpress.org/tickets/good-first-bugs).

3. Create and Submit a Patch

1. Make your changes locally.
2. Generate a patch file:
 `git diff > 12345.diff`
3. Upload the patch to the Trac ticket for review.

Solving a Problem
Let’s say you’re working on [Ticket #57897](https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/57897). After analyzing the issue, you create a patch and submit it for review. The WordPress Core team will review your patch, provide feedback, and, if everything looks good, merge it into the Core.

## **Final Thoughts**
Contributing to WordPress Core is a fantastic way to give back to the community while honing your skills. It might seem daunting at first, but the WordPress community is incredibly supportive. Start small, ask questions, and don’t be afraid to make mistakes. Remember, every contribution, no matter how small, makes a difference.
